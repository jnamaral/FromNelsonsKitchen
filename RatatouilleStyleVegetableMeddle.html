<!--l. 10--><p class="indent" >   I have a recipe for <a 
href="GrilledRatatouille.html" >Grilled Ratatouille</a> that is great to prepare later in the Summer when zucchinis are
plentiful. This is a variation using mushrooms and a technique that I developed for <a 
href="RustRoast.html" >Rust Roast</a>
when making the tomato sauce. This recipe can be prepared completely indoors by frying
the eggplants in olive oil, peeling the bell peppers with a small sharp knife and frying them
in the same pan, and then frying the onions, then the mushrooms, and making the tomato
sauce, all in the same pan. Each vegetable is cooked separated and put on a basin so that the
meddle is only mixed in the end. In this version, which I wrote for a traditional student party
“Cooking in Nelson’s Kitchen” mixes cooking on the grill and on a pan to make it possible to cook
outdoors during the times when we are still concerned with COVID transmission indoors.
