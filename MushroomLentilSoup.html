<!--l. 10--><p class="indent" >   I created the bacon version of this recipe one evening just by gathering ingredients that I had
around when I decided to invite a friend over for a weekday dinner and had no time to go
shopping. It turned out really good. When we invited many neighbours for an afternoon of
friendship with soup, bread, and drinks, I adapted it to become the vegan option for that
afternoon. I list both versions below. I like to cook the carrots and the mushroom separate
and add them at the last minute so that they keep their distinct ﬂavour and colour in the
soup.
