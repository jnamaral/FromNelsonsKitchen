<!--l. 11--><p class="indent" >   I have liked a dish called <span 
class="ecti-1095">Shrimp Bob</span><span 
class="ecti-1095">ó </span>since I ﬁrst learned about it in a trip to Bahia in the 1990s. It is
a delicious hearty soup with a base made with onions, tomatoes, hot pepper, coconut milk, thickened with
cooked mandioca and ﬂavoured with the heads and shells of shrimp. The shrimp themselves are
added at the last minute. A Bobó has a gravy thickened with the starch from the cooked
mandioca, but pieces of mandioca are still visible in the gravy alongside the barely cooked
shrimp.
</p><!--l. 13--><p class="indent" >   It was in a visit to a very special restaurant called Tordesilhas in São Paulo in 2022 that I was
introduced to the concept of a <span 
class="ecti-1095">Shrimp Bob</span><span 
class="ecti-1095">ózinho</span>. In Portuguese, the diminutive suﬃx <span 
class="ecti-1095">inho </span>makes
whatever it is modifying small. The idea is to make a more sophisticated version of this dish
and serve as an appetizer either in cups or in small bowls. The ﬂavours are essentially the
same, but this preparation and presentation turns it into a sophisticated appetizer or ﬁrst
course.
</p><!--l. 15--><p class="indent" >   This is a simple recipe, but there are several details that will aﬀect the ﬁnal product. Preparing the
shrimp broth, and being careful about how you handle the coconut milk, the cilantro, the
shrimp, and the dendê oil at the end are essential because of the volatile ﬂavours of these
products.
</p><!--l. 17--><p class="indent" >   You can buy frozen shrimps, thaw them, and prepare as speciﬁed in the recipe. In Edmonton I buy
peeled frozen mandioca at Tienda Latina. Make sure to pick bags where the mandioca does not have much
freeze burning. They also have dendê oil.

              <li class="itemize">Cut the shrimps. One elegant way is to slice each shrimp in half lengthwise and
              them, depending on their size, cut each half into two or three pieces so that one can
              still recognize the shrimps in the ﬁnal dish.

              <li class="itemize">You likely will have more cooked mandioca than you need for this recipe. You can
              use it for other dishes. Brazilians love to deep fry the cooked mandioca. In that case
              it is best to place the cooked mandioca on a wire rack over a baking sheet and let it
              dry in the fridge overnight before frying.
              </li>
              <li class="itemize">Pick the softest pieces of mandioca to add to this recipe. You can dice it into smaller
              pieces to make processing easier later. You will need about two cups.
              </li>
              <li class="itemize">You can also use the mandioca broth to thin the Bobózinho at the end if needed.</li></ul>
