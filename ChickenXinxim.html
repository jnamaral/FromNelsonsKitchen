<!--l. 9--><p class="indent" >   Chicken Xinxim is a dish traditional of Bahia. It has origen in Africa and there are many variations of
this dish in diﬀerent regions in Brazil. I composed this recipe after researching many others. To make a
good xinxim takes time, but most of the work can be done in advance. Some substitutions are possible, but
here I describe the procedure that I used for the <span 
class="ecti-1095">Festa Nordestina </span>organized by Brased in November
2008. The best shrimp for this dish is the fresh frozen shrimp from Thailand. The shrimp
must be prepped at least three days before you will cook the Xinxim, but it can be done even
a month in advance and frozen. I prefer to prepare my own dried shrimp and to roast and
grind my own peanut paste. I ﬁnd that the dried shrimp commercially available in ethnic
stores have a very punjent smell that overpowers the dish. The freshly roasted peanuts yield a
much more aromatic peanut paste. However you can substitute good quality peanut butter for
the home-made peanut paste. The red pepper that I use is <span 
class="ecti-1095">Pimenta de Cheiro</span>, a fragant and
not very hot pepper from Brazil. Make sure to read the whole recipe before you start any
preparation.

              a sharp knive.
