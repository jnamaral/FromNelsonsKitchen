<!--l. 10--><p class="indent" >   This make for very tasty Brussel sprouts. I add the radishes and the grape tomatoes for interesting
texture and colours. The exact amounts are not very important for this recipe. If blanching
other vegetables for the same dinner, blanch the other vegetables ﬁrst, blanching the Brussel
sprouts and the radishes last in this order. These two vegetables leave a strong ﬂavour in the
water.

              the drained sprouts. Stir for 30 seconds and then let it cook without stirring for a
              minute or two. The goal is to develop some golden spots in the sprouts.
