              <ul class="itemize1">
              <li class="itemize">Make a brining solution with the following proportions: for each two quarters of
              water, add 1/4 cup of table salt and 1/4 cup of sugar.
              </li>
              <li class="itemize">Add a generous amount of freshly cracked black pepper to the brine.
              </li>
              <li class="itemize">Add the zest from one or two lemons to the brine (best to use a lemon zester, but
              you can also use a small grater). If you zest on top of the water you will capture
              some of the lemon essential oils into the brine.
              </li>
              <li class="itemize">Add all the chicken to the brine and let sit, in the refrigerator, for at least two hours,
              but you can also keep them in the brine overnight.
              </li>
              <li class="itemize">Remove the chicken from the brine and put in a colander or over a rack inside a
              clean sink to let all the brine run out.
              </li>
              <li class="itemize">If you are doing the brining a day or two ahead, put the drained chicken into the
              fridge and leave it uncover for several hours to help it keep drying. After 10 or 12
              hours, cover the chicken so that it does not get too dry in the fridge.</li></ul>

              <ul class="itemize1">
              <li class="itemize">About one hour before you plan to start grilling, add some fresh lemon zest, fresh
              ground pepper, and the juice of one lemon to the chicken.</li></ul>

              <li class="itemize">Get your grill as hot as you can (my gas grill gets to 550F)
              </li>
              <li class="itemize">Brush the grill with a hard grill brush to make sure it is clean
              </li>
              <li class="itemize">Pour a small amount of oil in a small dish, fold a piece of paper towel several times
              and holding the folded paper towel with kitchen tongues, deep it in the oil and smear
              all over the grill. Cover the grill to let the oil burn for a minute. Repeat the process
              three or four times to reduce the stickiness of the grill.
              </li>
              <li class="itemize">Grill the chicken, leaving the ﬁrst side down longer than the second side.
              </li>
              <li class="itemize">As each piece of chicken gets done (internal temperature should be between140F and
              145F on an instant-read thermometer), remove it to a covered dish (either a bowl
              covered with a dinner plate or a heavy saucepan with a lead). It is very important
              to not overcook the chicken as it will continue cooking.
              </li>
              <li class="itemize">Keep the cooked chicken covered until it cools enough to handle (20 to 30 minutes).
              The chicken will release a signiﬁcant amount of juice while it rests. Make sure to
              preserve the juice.</li></ul>

              chicken.
              </li>
              <li class="itemize">Using either a sharp chefs knife or a sharp bread knife, slice the chicken very thinly
              and put back into the pan with the juices as you slice them.
              </li>
              <li class="itemize">Add a few tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil to the chicken.
              </li>
              <li class="itemize">Chop fresh thyme leaves and add to the chicken and toss well (best to use hands if
              making a generous amount of chicken) — if you do not have fresh thyme, you can
              use fresh Italian parsley.
              </li>
              <li class="itemize">Taste to decide if you think it needs more lemon juice or more extra virgin olive oil
              or more ground pepper.
