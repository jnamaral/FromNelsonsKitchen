<!--l. 9--><p class="indent" >   The origins of this recipe was a Windsor-Park Community League BBQ in 2017. My husband
suggested that instead of traditional frozen hamburger patties, the community should try something
diﬀerent. We oﬀered to contribute some BBQed drumsticks and I created this recipe for the event. It was a
success and many people asked me for the recipe.

              <li class="itemize">Using a sharp paring knife cut all the skin and tendons at the base of the bone of
              each drumstick. This is an important step because it will allow the meat to contract
              as it cook making for a more tender and meaty drumstick.
              </li>
              <li class="itemize">Wash the drumstick in cold water and discard the water.
              </li>
              <li class="itemize">In a container that will go into the fridge, mix 2 quarts of water with 1/4 cup of
              table salt and 1/4 cup of sugar and submerge the drumsticks in the water.
              </li>
              <li class="itemize">Refrigerate for at least one hour, but you can leave the chicken in the brining solution

              each drumstick over the leg meat.

              <li class="itemize">Put in the refrigerator, uncovered, for at least a couple of hours, but you can leave
