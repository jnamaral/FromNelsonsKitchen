<!--l. 8--><p class="indent" >   Daniel is milk intolerant and he liked bolognese sauce. This recipe started as a way to feed him some
protein and it has become the most important staple in our house. I make very large batches and
then freeze in small containers for individual serving portions. It can be microwaved from the
freezer to be served with pasta, rice or with ﬂour tortilla. A very successful recipe is “tortilla
pasta” which I provide as a separate recipe. I have been making this meat sauce for many years
and over time I have improved it to give it more meat ﬂavour and also to make it easier to
prepare. For a large batch, it takes a long time to make (approximately two days of slow oven
cooking). But most of the time it is not monitored. Daniel does not like to see vegetables or
onions in his sauce. Therefore I do process all the vegetables, including the can tomatoes in the
food processor to make sure that the sauce has no chunks of anything. I have large ovens
and large dutch oven pans. Before you make, check your equipment and oven to make sure
that you can ﬁt everything and adjust the recipe accordingly. I also have very large stainless
steel bowls (restaurant size) which makes it much easier to mix the meat with the wine and
seasonings before starting. The quantities are an approximation. You can vary the amount of
meat, tomatoes, onions, etc, and still have a very nice product. I do not add garlic to this base
sauce to make it more versatile. I may add garlic to pasta for example when serving with this
sauce. There is no pepper either. Again add freshly ground black pepper to the dish in which
you use the sauce. In Edmonton I always buy &#x0022;La Provencela&#x0022; can tomatoes in the Italian
Centre.

              you need to loosen up the meat and break all the lumps. The easiest way is to do so
              the next morning when the meat has cooled oﬀ. You can use your hands (with latex
              gloves if you wish). Otherwise, you can use a slotted metal spoon.</li></ul>

              <li class="itemize">If you see browning on the edge of the tomatoes, meat or vegetables, use a rubber
              spatula to loosen it and mix into the pot. The easiest way to do this is to lift a small
