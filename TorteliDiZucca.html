of Modena. From there we will taste <span 
class="ecti-1095">Tortelli di zucca alla Mantovana</span>, which is a delicate
tortelli ﬁled with a roasted pumpkin puree that is ﬂavoured with Mostarda di Cremona, a sweet
and spicy fruit in sirup. Cremona is not far to the North of the Reggio Emilia region. Note:
In Edmonton you ﬁnd the Mantovana squash at Superstore, at T&#x0026;T, or at Lucky 97. I use
butter and milk in the pasta to make a tender dough that is more suitable to the delicate
squash ﬁlling. The Mostarda di Cremona has to be mail order or acquired at an Italian store
elsewhere. It is important to prepare both the pasta and the ﬁlling several hours before forming the
raviolis.
