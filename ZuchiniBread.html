<!--l. 9--><p class="indent" >   This recipe gets to this collection through a tortuous route. In the early 1990s I was visiting Scott’s
aunt Diane in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and someone gave me this recipe cut out of a Sunday newspaper. The
main feature was that it has no fat and no eggs. I baked this bread many times. When moving to Brazil I
adapted it to use coyote squash, much more readily available there, and passed the recipe to my friend
Gloria, who lives in Santos, SP. I believe that Gloria was visiting in Porto Alegre of Xangrilá, RS,
when I baked the bread and she liked it very much. Then, years later, when we moved out
of a house in Newark, DE, we forgot my folder of recipes and the landlady discarded it. I
thought that I had lost the recipe and thought about it now and then. In 2017 I was at the
airport in Frankfurt, Germany, when I received a text message from Gloria with a picture of
the recipe saying, “Look what I found in a drawer! Great memories.&#x0022; Thus I recovered the
recipe.
</p><!--l. 11--><p class="indent" >   I like this bread very much because I like the ﬂavour of prunes. However, this is not a popular bread in
my house where others do not share this taste for prunes. I ﬁnd it curious that taste for prunes is
surprisingly dividing amongst people. If it is zuchini season you can make several loafs and store in the
freezer soon after baking.

              <li class="itemize">Cut a rectangular piece of parchment paper that covers the bottom of the loaf pan
              and that come up the long side of the pan.

              <ul class="itemize1">
              <li class="itemize">The best is to make a larger batch of the prune puree. If you are making a single
              recipe of the bread, you can store the remaining puree in small containers in the
              refrigerator or in the freezer.
              </li>
              <li class="itemize">Dice prunes and mix with a small amount of water and process in the blender or in
              a small food processor until you obtain a thick paste.
              </li>
              <li class="itemize">If making a single batch you can slowly add the 1 cup of water that the recipe calls
              for to the blender to loosen up the paste and make it easier to remove from the
              blender/processor. However do not add too much water too soon because the mixture
              must be thick to enable the breakdown of the prunes into a paste.</li></ul>

              <li class="itemize">Spread the diced prunes and the chopped nuts on top of the dry ingredients and

              distributed through the batter.
              </li>

              <li class="itemize">If it is completely cool when you serve, you may warm up a slice for 20 seconds in
              full power in the microwave. Best is to have a plastic cover over the slice.
