class="ecti-1095">à Milanesa </span>is a dish that says “home&#x0022; very loudly to me. This has been my favourite dish since I
was a child. The quality and the freshness of the beef and the eggs matters for this dish. When picking the
minute steaks at the store avoid anyone with brownish or greenish spots. It is also better if the steaks were
cut “against the grain”, <span 
class="ecti-1095">i.e. </span>in a way that sections long muscle ﬁbres. If you are able to, cut your own
minute steaks from a lean piece of beef, such as a sirloin. You can slice the minute steaks and season them
in advance. This dish is best if served as soon as it is ﬁnished. But it also tastes delicious as a cold snack or
in a sandwich the next day. If preparing a large number of minute steaks for a crowd, you can place
them on a rack over a baking sheet in a 200 F oven to keep them warm as you cook them in
batches.
</p><!--l. 11--><p class="indent" >   I speculate that this dish is an inﬂuence of the Italians that migrate to the South of Brazil in the mid
1870s.

              process to a ﬁne consistency in a food processor.

              <li class="itemize">Heat up a large heavy-bottom pan (you want it fairly hot, but not smoking) – a

              <li class="itemize">Add enough oil to generously coat the bottom of the pan.

              <li class="itemize">Cook for about 2 minutes in one side, turn and cook for another minute or two.
              </li>
              <li class="itemize">Watch the intensity of the ﬁre as you cook the steaks so that the pan does not
              become too hot or too cold.

              <li class="itemize">If you are preparing a large amount of steaks, as you ﬁnish each batch you can place
              on a wire rack over a rimmed baking sheet them in a 200 F oven, until you have
              ﬁnished them all.</li></ul>
