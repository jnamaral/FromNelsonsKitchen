<!--l. 10--><p class="indent" >   This recipe is inspired on a simple side dish in a simple sidewalk restaurant in Lyon in France. This is
an adaptation of the recipe for Grilled Ratatouille Provencal from the book <span 
class="ecti-1095">The New Professional Chef —</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">The Culinary Institute of America </span>editado por Mary Deirdre Donovan, edição 8, 1996. This adaptation
makes it very easy to make a very large batch for a large party. The best result is achieved by preparing
the infused olive oil, braised onions and tomato sauce two days before the party. Then grill
the vegetables and mix into the tomato sauce the day before. Keep the Ratatouille in the
refrigerator overnight. The day you will serve it, remove from the fridge early to allow it come come
back to room temperature. You can gently warm it up in a 180F oven to serve it lukewarm.
