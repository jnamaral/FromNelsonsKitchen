class="ecti-1095">Mandioca Frita </span>is a traditional appetizer served throughout the South of Brazil. The freshly cooked
yucca with the steam raising from the dish is a very popular side dish to serve with grilled meats. The
fried yucca is usually prepared the day after the yucca was cooked and served plain boiled. The
yucca that we ﬁnd in supermarkets in North America is waxed for preservation. When buying
try to select roots that are not bruised and that do not have dark spots. Always buy extra
because you will waste some. Prefer the middle thickness as often the very thick specimens are
woody.
</p><!--l. 19--><p class="indent" >   When harvested fresh from the soil, the yucca is very easy to peel. It has a double skin, a very thin
paper like skin and a thicker white skin underneath. You have to remove both of them. In the freshly
harvested yucca the white skin separates from the center of the root eﬀortlessly. I used to have a very
diﬃcult time peeling the waxed yucca that we ﬁnd in North America because the skin seems to be ﬁrmly
attached to the centre. Now I discovered that soaking the roots for a few minutes in very warm water
expands the skin and loosens it from the root, making it almost as easy to peel as the freshly harvested
roots.
</p><!--l. 30--><p class="indent" >   A much easier alternative is to buy frozen yucca that has already been peeled. You can ﬁnd it at
Paraíso Tropical, SuperStore and sometimes at Chinese stores such as Lucky 97.
