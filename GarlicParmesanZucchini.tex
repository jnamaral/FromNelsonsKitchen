Zucchini is a great Summer squash, however cooking it can be tricky. I have found out that the secret is to pretty much not cook it at all, similar to the technique used in Chinese stir frying. However, it is difficult to impart flavour into the squash with such a brief cooking time. The techniques that I introduce into this recipe aim to impart flavour into this Summer squash without cooking it for long. The idea is remove the seeds and then to salt it ahead and thus remove some of the water, and then to impart flavour to the oil before introducing the squash to it.
