<!--l. 9--><p class="indent" >   In most of Brazil beans and rice is an everyday staple. In the Southeast of Brazil everyday beans are
brown beans such as pinto beans or kidney beans. Black beans are reserved for a special Saturday meal,
served in many restaurants in Rio de Janeiro, called <span 
class="ecti-1095">Feijoada</span>. But in the South of Brazil the everyday
beans are the black beans. Here we are preparing this everyday version of the dish as it is usually done in
Rio Grande do Sul. In Edmonton the best place for smoked meats for the beans is K&#x0026;K Foodliner on
Whyte Ave. A nice tip is to ask for smoked bones, which are much less expensive and have lots
of meat on them. K&#x0026;K also has great smoked bacon. The best place to buy black beans in
Edmonton is the Italian Centre. It is important to mash the beans with a fork rather than using a
blender or food processor because you do not want the skins of the beans to be triturated by a
machine.
