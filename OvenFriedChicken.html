<!--l. 10--><p class="indent" >   Often I buy large packages of boneless skinless chicken breasts to grill or to cook in a pan. I brine and
freeze the individual chicken breasts to have them ready for use later. However the chicken breast are not
in a good shape for cooking. Thus, I remove the tenderloins, I cut oﬀ the triangular thin end of the
breasts. If the breasts are specially thick, I put them in their sides and cut a slice from the
under side of the thick end. The goal is to make the chicken breast more even for cooking in
the grill or in a pan. For example, see the recipe for <a 
href="SlicedGrilledChicken.html" >Sliced Grilled Chicken</a> for an use of the
breasts. This recipe is what I do with the tenderloins and the bits of chicken breasts that I left
from the trimming. You can also prepare it with whole breasts, ideally cut them into strips to
increase the amount of crisp bits. I have also done this very well with boneless skinless chicken
thighs.
