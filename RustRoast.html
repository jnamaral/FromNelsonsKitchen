<!--l. 10--><p class="indent" >   This roast has very few ingredients to lend it ﬂavours. The rich ﬂavour relies on extensive careful
browning of both the meat and the tomatoes. This is my version of a dish known in Brazil at home as
“Carne the Panela&#x0022;, which translates to “Beef Cooked in a Pot.&#x0022; This dish is also found there in more
upscale restaurants as “Carne com Molho Ferrugem&#x0022; which translates to “Beef with Rust Sauce&#x0022;. The
word Rust refers to the colour of the meat and the sauce due to the browning. I like to use a
wide-bottom cast-iron pan to brown the beef and the tomatoes. The cast iron is the original pan for
this recipe in Brazil and it does produce the best result in terms of colour and ﬂavour. It is
also the easiest equipment to use because it cause the right amount of sticking to the pot to
produce the desired rust sauce. You can also use a heavy-bottom stainless still pan. I have found
that an enamel pan is not the best for browning and that aluminium pans can get too hot
too quickly. However, I do like to transfer the entire dish to a heavy enamel dutch oven for
the braising in the oven. Resist the temptation to add black pepper, bay leaves, or any other
traditional ﬂavourings of beef stews. You are after the purity of the beef and tomato marriage
and you want to show oﬀ your technique in this dish by building the ﬂavours in the way you
cook these two ingredients. This dish requires a fair amount of time and attention to ensure
that the browning of the meat and tomatoes is done properly. It also needs some time in the
oven. It is an ideal make-ahead dish for a dinner party. The ﬁnal product is well worth the
dedication.

          <span 
class="ecbx-1095">day ahead.)</span>
              <ul class="itemize1">
              <li class="itemize">Cut the beef into large pieces (about 3x2x2 inches) ensuring that you cut across the
              muscle ﬁber.
              </li>
              <li class="itemize">Sprinkle very lightly with salt on all sides.
              </li>
              <li class="itemize">Lightly coat the beef pieces with soy sauce — the amount of soy sauce depends on
              how salty your soy sauce is.
              </li>
              <li class="itemize">Spread a light coat of prepared Dijon mustard on the beef (about 1 Tablespoon for 3
              pounds of meet). You don’t want any distinct ﬂavour of mustard in the ﬁnal product.
              A light touch of mustard increases the meat ﬂavour.
              </li>
              <li class="itemize">Let it seat for at least one hour (at room temperature) and up to 24 hours (in the
              refrigerator). If refrigerated, you may take it out of the fridge a couple of hours before
              you will start cooking.</li></ul>
          </li>
          <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-5x2"><span 
class="ecbx-1095">Brown the beef</span>
              <ul class="itemize1">
              <li class="itemize">Heat a wide-bottom cast iron pan over medium-high heat until it is very hot but not
              smoking.
              </li>
              <li class="itemize">Pour oil only enough to coat the bottom of the pan. Gently swirl the pan to coat
              about 1/4 inch around the sides to prevent burning.
              </li>
              <li class="itemize">Put pieces of meat into the pan so that they are not touching each other or the sides
              of the pan — you will work on batches. You can cover the pot to reduce splashing
              leaving a small space for the steam to escape.
              </li>
              <li class="itemize">When the initial pieces have turned grey on top and liquid has evaporated, turn all
              the pieces to the other side (tongs are best for this). You can add a few more pieces
              of meat to the pan because the original ones have shrunk.
              </li>
              <li class="itemize">Keep an eye on your ﬁre. Too hot and the meat will brown too fast too quickly with
              the risk of developing bitter ﬂavour compounds. Too low a ﬁre and the browning
              will take a long time. You want the meat to turn rust colour, not to turn black. At
              any point that the browning is going too far, add a bit of water to the pan and rub
              the pieces of meat onto brown bits that are stuck to the pan — you can also use a
              ﬂat wooden spoon to scrape the brown bits into the sauce. Whenever you add water
              or raw meat to the pan you should see a rust-colour sauce form. Move the pieces of
              meat around so that they soak up this sauce.
              </li>
              <li class="itemize">You can keep pieces of meat that are already browned in the pan as you keep adding
              fresh raw meat. This process of browning and adding liquid to release the brown bits
              from the pan is the technique to create the rust sauce.
                                                                                         

                                                                                         
              </li>
              <li class="itemize">If the pan gets crowded or if some pieces of meat start getting very dark and dry,
              remove those pieces from the browning pan into a clean heavy enamel dutch oven.
              </li>
              <li class="itemize">While the meat is browning, prepare the tomatoes (see below) and open the tomato
              paste can.
              </li>
              <li class="itemize">Once all the pieces of meat are browned, remove all the meat to the dutch.</li></ul>

              </li>
              <li class="itemize">Using a pair of kitchen scissors (or a small knife or spatula) cut each whole tomato
              in half.
              </li>
              <li class="itemize">Gently turn the whole tomatoes over the strainer with a rubber spatula to drain the
              juices, but do not mash up the tomatoes — keep the tomatoes as whole as you can.

              <li class="itemize">Once all the beef is browned and removed from the pan, add the drained tomatoes,
              without the liquid, to the hot pan.

              <li class="itemize">Let the tomatoes cook in the fat until they are fairly dry and they also start to
              acquire a rust colour.
              </li>
              <li class="itemize">You need to watch fairly closely because tomatoes have a signiﬁcant amount of sugar.
              It takes a bit of time for their liquid to evaporate. But, once all their liquid has
              evaporated they can burn very quickly. You want to get to the roasted-tomato stage,
              but not to the burned stage.
              </li>
              <li class="itemize">If needed, at any moment you can add a few droplets of water to prevent the tomatoes
              from burning, but only do that if needed as it will prolong your cooking time.
              </li>
              <li class="itemize">When the tomatoes are roasted, dump the entire small can of tomato paste into the
              pan and stir fry with a ﬂat wooden spoon until the tomato paste becomes drier and
              acquires a slightly darker colour.
